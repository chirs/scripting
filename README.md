## Scripting

#### A repository exploring the intersection of computer science and architecture.


### Brief

The most common word used to describe computer programming in architecture school is "scripting," a diminuitive that brings to mind "script kiddies" cutting-and-pasting php scripts to attempt to exploit websites, or middle managers who don't really know what programmers do. 

As a former computer programmer, I naturally recoiled from this word, as well as its partner in crime, "parametricism" - the term used to describe a computer-generated form that is at best only superficially understood. 

#### Reappropriation

What does scripting mean, in architecture, in programming, in the public imagination?

Scripting occurs when a "user" utilizes some sort of computer code (thereby reconfiguring roles?)

"design computing"

computer as assistant vs. computer as design agent.

#### Exploration

This is an attempt to explore more completely the idea of architecture and computer being more fully embedded. What does this consist of?

* Architectural Geometry - NURBS, subdivs, etc. - what are the different ways to model 2d, 3d, and 4d space, and what are their strengths and weaknesses?
* Architectural "scripting languages" - Rhino Python, Auto Lisp, and the like
* Graphical Programming - Grasshopper and extensions (Weaverbird, etc.)
* Artificial Intelligence - how can architecture

#### Notes 

Physical form, according to D'Arcy Thompson (1917), is the resolution at one instant of time of many forces that are governed by rates of change - Negroponte / Architecture machine.
