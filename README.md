A repository exploring the idea of scripting.

====

The most common word used to describe computer programming in architecture school is "scripting." As a former computer programmer, I instinctively recoil from the word.

What does scripting mean, in architecture, in programming, in the public imagination?



Scripting language
==================

Types
==================
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language]

Glue languages - Shell, Python
Job control - JCL
GUI Scripting - Grasshopper?
Application-specific languages - Emacs Lisp
Extension/embeddable languages - ECMAScript


History
=======
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language#History]

"Early mainframe computers (in the 1950s) were non-interactive, instead using batch processing. IBM's Job Control Language (JCL) is the archetype of languages used to control batch processing.[5]

The first interactive shells were developed in the 1960s to enable remote operation of the first time-sharing systems, and these used shell scripts, which controlled running computer programs within a computer program, the shell. Calvin Mooers in his TRAC language is generally credited with inventing command substitution, the ability to embed commands in scripts that when interpreted insert a character string into the script.[6] Multics calls these active functions.[7] Louis Pouzin wrote an early processor for command scripts called RUNCOM for CTSS around 1964. Stuart Madnick at MIT wrote a scripting language for IBM's CP/CMS in 1966. He originally called this processor COMMAND, later named EXEC.[8] Multics included an offshoot of CTSS RUNCOM, also called RUNCOM.[9] EXEC was eventually replaced by EXEC 2 and REXX.

Languages such as Tcl and Lua were specifically designed as general purpose scripting languages that could be embedded in any application. Other languages such as Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) provided strong integration with the automation facilities of an underlying system. Embedding of such general purpose scripting languages instead of developing a new language for each application also had obvious benefits, relieving the application developer of the need to code a language translator from scratch and allowing the user to apply skills learned elsewhere.

Some software incorporates several different scripting languages. Modern web browsers typically provide a language for writing extensions to the browser itself, and several standard embedded languages for controlling the browser, including JavaScript (a dialect of ECMAScript) or XUL."
