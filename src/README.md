### src/

Folder for my own work in various "scripting" media. 

What does this need?

Cool form generators.

Cool images from p5.




### Programming languages 



* js -> javascript files, currently just work on p5.js
* gh -> grasshopper files, could potentially be merged with architecture_tools
* processing -> processing work (mostly to help classmates)
* py -> python work, nothing much yet. Rhino / Maya scripting?
